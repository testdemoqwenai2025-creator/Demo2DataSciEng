Task ID: github-sync-setup
Agent: Super Z (main)
Task: Create two GitHub repos (DemoAppDataSci public + AppDataSci-Advanced private), push code to private, set up one-way sync workflow (private→public), add About page + GDPR footer + Home button + dark/light toggle to every page.

Work Log:
- Added new PageId "about" to router.ts with new "About" group
- Built About page (_pages/about.tsx) — mission, synthetic-data disclaimer, GDPR rights table (Art. 15/16/17/20/21/18), repository links, contact email
- Rewrote app-shell.tsx — added "Return to Home" button (visible on all non-home pages, both desktop and mobile), updated footer with GDPR notice + GitHub email + repo links
- Added "About" group to sidebar nav
- Created README.md and proper .gitignore (excluding skills/, .zscripts/, .env, scripts with PATs)
- Created .github/workflows/sync-to-public.yml — GitHub Actions workflow that mirrors push-to-main on private repo to public repo
- Committed locally as eb384c4
- Wrote scripts/setup-github.sh (idempotent: verifies PAT, creates both repos, pushes to private + public)
- Executed setup-github.sh with the user-provided PAT — both repos created, code pushed to both
- Wrote scripts/set-sync-secret.py using pynacl (NaCl sealed box) to encrypt + upload SYNC_TO_PUBLIC_PAT secret to private repo (HTTP 201)
- Triggered sync workflow manually — Run #1 failed (no secret yet, expected), Run #2 succeeded after secret was set
- First cleanup commit (11ede91) pushed .env + .zscripts/ removal — Run #4 failed because --force-with-lease needs a remote tracking ref which the fresh checkout doesn't have
- Fixed sync workflow to use plain --force (one-way mirror, intentional) committed as e382b99
- Manually triggered Run #5 — succeeded; public repo now exactly mirrors private (HEAD e382b99 on both)

Stage Summary:
- Public repo: https://github.com/testdemoqwenai2025-creator/DemoAppDataSci (private=false, default=main)
- Private repo: https://github.com/testdemoqwenai2025-creator/AppDataSci-Advanced (private=true, default=main)
- Both repos have identical HEAD commit (e382b99) and contain 138 tracked files
- Sync workflow .github/workflows/sync-to-public.yml runs on push to main (paths-ignore .github/workflows/** to prevent loops)
- SYNC_TO_PUBLIC_PAT secret configured on private repo (encrypted with NaCl sealed box)
- All future pushes to private main will auto-mirror to public via the workflow
- About page (hash #/about), GDPR footer with email, Return-to-Home button, dark/light toggle all functional on every page
